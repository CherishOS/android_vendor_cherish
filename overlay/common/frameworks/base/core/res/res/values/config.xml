         app standby.  These are not enabled by default because they require a standard
         cloud-to-device messaging service for apps to interact correctly with the modes
         (such as to be able to deliver an instant message to the device even when it is
         dozing).  This should be enabled if you have such services and expect apps to
         correctly use them when installed on your device.  Otherwise, keep this disabled

         There are many prerequisites for this feature to work correctly.
         Here are a few of them:
         * The WiFi radio must support WiFi P2P.
         * The WiFi radio must support concurrent connections to the WiFi display and
           to an access point.
         * The Audio Flinger audio_policy.conf file must specify a rule for the "r_submix"
           remote submix module.  This module is used to record and stream system
           audio output to the WiFi display encoder in the media server.
         * The remote submix module "audio.r_submix.default" must be installed on the device.
         * The device must be provisioned with HDCP keys (for protected content).
